[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dcc3a06f-99aa-4007-a795-5a0df889dced/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/pkfr/deploys)

## Quick Start

Clone or download [this repo](https://github.com/m-a-x-s-e-e-l-i-g/pkfr-nl), then install the dependencies and run the dev server:

```
npx degit https://github.com/m-a-x-s-e-e-l-i-g/pkfr-nl pkfr-nl
cd pkfr-nl
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

That should get a dev server up and running (assuming you have npm and Node installed already). Any saved changes to components and styles should auto-refresh blazingly fast.

You should add some credentials to the `.env` file. To guarantee everything functioning right.

## Managing Jams

Jams are added, updated or deleted via Google Calendar.
Please open up an issue or send me a message if information needs to be updated.

## Managing Open Gyms

Open Gyms are added, updated or deleted via Google Calendar.
Please open up an issue or send me a message if information needs to be updated.

## Static files

Things that should just live in the site root of the finished site (like a `robots.txt` file, favicon, or maybe images) should go in the `static` folder. If you link to them, use the root path (e.g., `/images/my.png`, not `../static/images/my.png`).

## Building and deploying

The build command (from package.json) is simply:

```
npm run build
```

Use `npm run preview` _after_ a build to preview the built site.
